# Predicting LoL game winner

League of Legends (LoL) is a 5v5 multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game.
Teams compete to destroy the enemy's base structure, the Nexus.

Our project goal is to predict the winning team based on events occurring within
the first `N` minutes of professional matches.


## Dataset

The dataset consists of three CSV files: `game_metadata.csv`, `game_players_stats.csv`,
and `game_events.csv`. The fields `game_id` and `player_id` link these files.

### Source

The dataset contains detailed statistics and events from professional LoL matches (2019-2024).
It was published on
[IEEE DataPort under a CC license](https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/league-legends-esports-player-game-data-2019-2024). 
However, since IEEE is a greedy corporation, accessing it there requires a paid subscription.

We obtained the identical dataset directly from the authors' GitHub repository
([PandaScore/PandaSkill](https://github.com/PandaScore/PandaSkill)). This source
provides the data under the permissive MIT license.

### `game_metadata.csv`

This file contains general information about each game.

*   `game_id`: Unique game identifier.
*   `date`: Game date and time in format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.ssssss.
*   `match_id`: Identifier for the match (e.g., a best-of-5 series).
*   `tournament_id`: Unique tournament identifier.
*   `tournament_name`: Name of the tournament.

*   `series_name`: Name of the series (e.g., LCK Summer 2024).
*   `league_id`: Unique league identifier.
*   `league_name`: Name of the league (e.g., LCK).

*   `largest_killing_spree`: Player's largest killing spree count.
*   `largest_multi_kill`: Player's largest multi-kill count (e.g., 2 for double kill).

### `game_events.csv`

This file contains specific events occurring during each game.

*   `game_id`: Unique game identifier.
*   `timestamp`: Time in seconds when the event occurred.
*   `event_type`: Type of event (e.g., `player_kill`, `dragon_kill`).

library(scales)

metadata <- read_csv("data/game_metadata.csv", show_col_types = F)

## Hypothesis

We hypthetize that if a team has more kills (player, tower, dragon) in early game
(events that happen before `N`th minute), then they are more likely to win the whole
game.

## Representing early game state

We will create features representing the relative advantage between the two teams at the
`N` minute. This involves calculating the difference in key objectives (kills,
dragons, heralds, towers, voidgrubs) and identifying which team secured the first
significant event (first blood, first dragon, first herald).

### Steps

1.  **Identify teams:** For each `game_id`, determine the two competing `team_id`s from `player_stats`.
	Assign one as `team1_id` and the other as `team2_id`.
2.  **Determine winner:** Create the target variable `team1_won` (1 if `team1_id` won, 0 otherwise)
	using the `win` column from `player_stats`.
3.  **Map players to teams:** Create a lookup to find the `team_id` for any `player_id` within a specific `game_id`.
4.  **Filter events:** Select events from `game_events.csv` where `timestamp <= N`.
5.  **Calculate features:** For each `game_id`, using the filtered events and player-team mapping:
    *   Calculate the difference in kills between teams.
    *   Calculate the difference in dragon kills.
    *   Calculate the difference in Rift Herald kills.
    *   Calculate the difference in towers destroyed.
    *   Calculate the difference in voidgrubs kills.
    *   Identify which team achieved first blood.
    *   Identify which team took the first dragon.
    *   Identify which team took the first herald.
6.  **Combine data:** Aggregate these features by `game_id` and join them with the `team1_won` target variable.

### Resulting Dataset Structure

The final dataset will have one row per `game_id`. Each row represents the state
of a game after `N` minutes, along with the final outcome. Columns will include:

*   `game_id`: Unique game identifier.
*   `kill_diff`: Numeric difference (team 1 kills - team 2 kills).
*   `drake_diff`: Numeric difference (team 1 dragons - team 2 dragons).
*   `herald_diff`: Numeric difference (team 1 heralds - team 2 heralds).
*   `tower_diff`: Numeric difference (team 1 towers - team 2 towers).
*   `grub_diff`: Numeric difference (team 1 grubs - team 2 grubs).
*   `first_blood`: Factor indicating which team got the first kill ('team1', 'team2', 'none').
*   `first_dragon`: Factor indicating which team got the first dragon ('team1', 'team2', 'none').
*   `first_herald`: Factor indicating which team got the first herald ('team1', 'team2', 'none').
*   `team1_won`: Factor or numeric target variable (1 if team 1 won, 0 otherwise).

```


## EDA

### Target `team1_won`

```{r}
ggplot(dataset, aes(x = factor(team1_won))) +
    geom_bar(aes(y = after_stat(count)), fill = c(color1, color2)) +
    geom_text(
        aes(y = after_stat(count), label = after_stat(count)),
        stat = "count",
        vjust = -0.5
    ) +
    scale_x_discrete(labels = c("0" = "Team 2 Wins", "1" = "Team 1 Wins")) +
    labs(
        title = "Distribution of game outcomes",
        subtitle = paste("Based on", nrow(dataset), "games"),
        x = "Outcome",
        y = "Number of games"
    ) +
    theme_minimal()
```
The dataset appears reasonably balanced between team 1 and team 2 wins. Around
47% to 53%.

### Diffs

```{r fig.width=12}
dataset %>%
    select(ends_with("_diff")) %>%
    colnames() %>%
    map(~ {
        col_sym <- sym(.x)
        ggplot(dataset, aes(x = !!col_sym)) +
            geom_histogram(
                binwidth = 1,
                center = 0,
                fill = color1,
                color = "black",
                alpha = 0.8
            ) +
            labs(x = .x, y = "Number of games") +
            theme_minimal()
    }) %>%
    wrap_plots(ncol = 3)
```

```{r}
numeric_data_for_corr <- dataset %>% select(ends_with("_diff"))
cor_matrix <- cor(numeric_data_for_corr, use = "pairwise.complete.obs")
custom_palette <- colorRampPalette(c(color1, "white", color2))(100)
corrplot(cor_matrix,
    method = "color", col = custom_palette, type = "upper",
    tl.col = "black", tl.srt = 45, addCoef.col = "black", number.cex = 1,
    diag = F, mar = c(0, 0, 1, 0)
)
```

Distributions of `kill_diff` and `tower_diff` seem promising.
Also the correlation matrix seems promising, no strong correlation between
`_diff` features.
