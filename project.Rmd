# Predicting LoL game winner

League of Legends (LoL) is a 5v5 multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game.
Teams compete to destroy the enemy's base structure, the Nexus.

Our project goal is to predict the winning team based on events occurring within
the first 10 minutes of professional matches.

## Data Source

The dataset contains detailed statistics and events from professional LoL matches (2019-2024).
It was originally published on IEEE DataPort under a CC license. However, since
IEEE is a greedy corporation, accessing it there requires a paid subscription.

We obtained the identical dataset directly from the authors' GitHub repository
([PandaScore/PandaSkill](https://github.com/PandaScore/PandaSkill)). This source
provides the data under the permissive MIT license.


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
library(patchwork)

metadata <- read_csv("data/game_metadata.csv")
player_stats <- read_csv("data/game_players_stats.csv")
events <- read_csv("data/game_events.csv")
```
